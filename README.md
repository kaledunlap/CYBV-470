# CYBV-470 | C Programming Final Project <br>
This is my final project for the C programming course CYBV-470 taken at the University of Arizona (Online). This course was challenging and covered programming security principles using assembly language. CYBV-470 meets the National Security Agency (NSA) Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) academic requirements for low-level programming. <br>
<br>
CYBV-470 primarily focused on the following: <br>
1. Developing, testing and debugging multithreaded programs. <br>
2. Writing a properly formatted C program. <br>
3. Identifing how to leverage object oriented programming in C. <br>




Shown in this repository are the instructions I was provided for this project, along with my final completed project. I was able to score a 97% on this assignment, and finish the course with the overall grade of an A.
